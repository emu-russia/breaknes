# FastAPU

A priori fast version of APUSim, so as not to confuse code with "fast" branches.

- BaseLogicLib is not used (regular C logical operators are used)
- All vectorized signals, buses and modules (e.g. counters) are packed into multi-bit variables
- No debugging yet

Otherwise, the code structure is the same as in APUSim, so don't get lost.

WIP.
