# Breaknes

NES/Famicom/Dendy emulator at the gate level.

## Build

Use VS2022.

Unfortunately, there are a huge number of usability bugs:
- Don't touch menu items or handler links will break
- Form designer just crashes sometimes for no reason
- Custom controls appear in Toolbox, but then disappear
- Form properties are not displayed when you click on its title through the editor
