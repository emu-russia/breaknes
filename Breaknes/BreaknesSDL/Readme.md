# BreaknesSDL

For those who like minimalism - Breaknes build using SDL2.

The implementation does not differ from Managed application: the same native part of BreaksCore from DLL is used. Chip revisions and motherboard cannot be selected yet (NESBoard+RP2A03G+RP2C02G is hardcoded in main.cpp).

The IO subsystem is also not yet integrated into the SDL build.
