Ready to countdown!

## Build

Use Windows and VS2022. Dotnet 6.0 **Desktop** Runtime is also required.

Builds for Linux will be available as soon as everything settles down.

## Procrastination Chart

- Breaknes GUI (managed part): 80%
- BreaksCore (native part): 80%
- 6502 Core: 100%
- APU: 100%
- PPU: 100%
- Boards: 4/6
- Mappers: 0.5 (Only NROM partially)

The values reflect mostly a subjective feeling about reaching a critical mass of code. Bugs and improvements can be made ad infinitum.

Of course, as things stand now, we can't stop you from using the source code in your "frontends", getting donations, and bragging on Twitter about how fucking awesome you are. But at least write not how fucking awesome you are, but how fucking awesome we are. That's the thing about karma.
